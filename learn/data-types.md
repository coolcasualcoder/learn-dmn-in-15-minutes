You'll frequently handle data when you build a DMN model, and when you think about data, you need to think about types.

Sometimes you will face very simple situations, like this:

On this example, the decision node, possibly a decision table, checks the input nodes **Age** and **Driver license type**. In this example the _values_ for these input nodes are, respectively, the number `28` and the string `"Class A"`, since this person looks old enough and has the properly license, the decision node returns the boolean `true`.

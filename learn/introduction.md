        The primary goal of DMN is to provide a standard notation that is readily understandable by all kinds of users.
        Business analysts can define the initial decision requirements, technical developers can create complex decision
        logic and automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic, and also, business
        stakeholders can manage and monitor those decisions.

        Thus, DMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business decision design and decision
        implementation.

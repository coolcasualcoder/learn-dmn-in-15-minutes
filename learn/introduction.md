Welcome to the **Learn DMN in 15 minutes** course!

Into this course, you will understand that the primary goal of DMN is to provide a standard notation that is readily understandable by all kinds of users:

- **Business Analysts** can define the initial decision requirements;
- **Technical Developers** can create complex decision logic and automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic;
- and **Business Stakeholders** can manage and monitor those decisions.

DMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business decision design and decision implementation.
